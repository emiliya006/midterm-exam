        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am a 1 year student of <a href="https://alatoo.edu.kg/en/" target="_blank" id="link_ala-too">Ala-Too International University</a> . I am adolescent (18 years old). I was studying at <a href="http://bilimkana.kg/" target="_blank" id="link_bilimkana"> Bilimkana High School.</a> In 10th grade Cherity Club announced a set of volunteers, which I successfully passed and became a volunteer. I provided many events such as visiting The Children's boarding schools, the Elderly Home and the organization of The Chess Tournament for children with disabilities. Cherity is an essential part of my life. That's what I am
        truthfully enjoing.</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would discribe myself as open-minded cheerful responsible person. I always take responsibility no matter what situation is it. I am that kind of person who easily can find right ways to solve a problem. My strong sides are flexibility, perseverance, leadership qualities that play a big role in teamwork.I gained leadership qualities because of large amount of events and competitions that the school provided us. Thus, from a closed, insecure girl, I radically changed to a confident one. </p>

        <h2> Interests</h2>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a person who likes to read,draw, walk and I can not live without music. Probably very creative and inquisitive. The interest in reading in 9th grade after transferring to a new school, at more conscious age I realized that reading allows you foret about reality and immerse yourself in fiction world. Thus, expanding your knowledge range. I have been draving since early childhood, I participated in various competitions,many will say that it is just typical drawings. However for me to it is a reflection of my boundless imagination sometimes you can clearly see the autor's soul especially his feelings.</p>
